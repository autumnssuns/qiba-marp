# Are you predominantly a leader or follower? Explain why?

- A follower first due to lack of experience in the industry
- Wish to learn and understand others' perspectives first
- When experienced, become a contributor, and eventually a leader

---

# Are you predominantly a risk taker or do you play things safe, explain why?

- Mostly play things safe, but comfortable with the unknown
- Like to have a plan, but also don't mind improvising (as I'm quite flexible)
- Always try to learn from the experience
