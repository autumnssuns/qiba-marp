<div style="margin-top: -20px">

> **Communication is key**

</div>

<small>

| **Age**                                         | **Culture**                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documentation** on technologies and workflow  | Raise **Cultural Awareness** such as Acknowledgement of Country |
| **Manage Expectations** and **Provide Support** | Multi-modality of **Learning and Teaching**                     |

Comparison with **Vietnamese** practices:

- Vietnam: <span class="slide-in">**Respect for Elders** and workplace **Hierarchy**.</span>
- Australia: <span class="slide-in">**Equality** and **Inclusivity**.</span>

</small>

<!--

# Legislative Requirements

<!-- 
EEO and Fair Work laws

EEO: Equal Employment Opportunity
Fair Work: Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)
 -->

Both **Age** and **Racial Discrimination Acts** aim to provide <span class="slide-in">**equal employment opportunities**</span> **(EEO)**, making it unlawful to, based on age or cultural background:


- <span class="slide-in">Hire, fire, or treat someone unfairly</span>
- <span class="slide-in">Harass or bully someone</span>
- <span class="slide-in">Deny or limit access to services, resources or benefits</span>


[**Fair Work Act 2009**](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/legislation) provides safety net of <span class="slide-in">**minimum entitlements**</span> and <span class="slide-in">**fairness at work**</span>, covering unfair dismissal, bullying and general protections.
