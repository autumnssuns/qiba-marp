# Legislative Requirements

<!-- 
EEO and Fair Work laws

EEO: Equal Employment Opportunity
Fair Work: Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)
 -->

Both **Age** and **Racial Discrimination Acts** aim to provide <span class="slide-in">**equal employment opportunities**</span> **(EEO)**, making it unlawful to, based on age or cultural background:


- <span class="slide-in">Hire, fire, or treat someone unfairly</span>
- <span class="slide-in">Harass or bully someone</span>
- <span class="slide-in">Deny or limit access to services, resources or benefits</span>


[**Fair Work Act 2009**](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/legislation) provides safety net of <span class="slide-in">**minimum entitlements**</span> and <span class="slide-in">**fairness at work**</span>, covering unfair dismissal, bullying and general protections.
