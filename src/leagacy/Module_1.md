## Case Study: BM Services

Scenario:

You are contracted to conduct an audit of customer service standards in a Business Management Company (BM Services), a business that supplies I.T. support, Accounting services, Management and HRM Advice to other businesses. BM Services is losing return customers and the head office regularly receives complaints about poor service standards.  

You have surveyed BM Service staff dealing with customers (internal and external) using various methods: (mystery shopper; in office surveys; customer feedback and complaints data analysis) and you have identified a number of problems.
a)	Mystery shoppers revealed the following:
•	Reception staff have good communication skills, but wait times are long
•	On-line support staff (desk help) were inefficient and wait times too long
•	Staff on client support visits often did not keep to appointment times
b)	Complaints analysis found:
•	In many cases, system support staff lacked focus on individual business needs and did not deliver what was promised
•	Software advisory staff and network engineers often assumed detailed IT knowledge of customers (leading to confusion). 
•	In some cases the design specifications (of business software) did not match the requirements of the client, causing a lot of after sales difficulty
c)	Customer feedback comments:
•	Support staff are not polite
•	Phone systems are often engaged or have long wait periods
•	Workplace environment seemed ‘tense’, with staff fighting among themselves
•	The company was too strict with overdue accounts
•	The customer experience with software products (e.g. CSM) was often unsatisfactory, due to a lack of after sales service
d) Survey responses overall showed that:
            58% will return       18% might return, but are not happy         24% will not return


Using RATER, the following areas were identified as needing improvement:

### Reliability

From a)
- Staff on client support visits often did not keep to appointment times (because this indicate the lack of timeliness and punctuality)

### Assurance

From b)
- In some cases, the design specifications (of business software) did not match the requirements of the client, causing a lot of after sales difficulty (indication of lack of credibility due to failure to meet customer’s requirement)
- In many cases, system support staff lacked focus on individual business needs and did not deliver what was promised (failure to deliver what was promised, indicating lack of credibility)

From c)
- Support staff are not polite (evident of lack of respect for customers)

### Tangibles

From c)
- Workplace environment seemed ‘tense’, with staff fighting among themselves (related to the employees culture, in creating a safe environment, or the lack thereof)

### Empathy

From b)
- Software advisory staff and network engineers often assumed detailed IT knowledge of customers (leading to confusion). (shows lack of understanding of the customer)

From c)
- The company was too strict with overdue accounts (related to the lack of understanding of special needs)
- The customer experience with software products (e.g. CSM) was often unsatisfactory, due to a lack of after sales service (related to the lack of understanding of customers’ needs to provide adequate services)

From d)
- 58% will return       18% might return, but are not happy         24% will not return (failure to understand customers’ needs lead to unsatisfactory experience. However the data is somewhat vague and could fall under any category)

### Responsiveness

From a)
- Reception staff have good communication skills, but wait times are long (related to the ability to provide prompt service)
- On-line support staff (desk help) were inefficient and wait times too long (again, the inability to provide timely service)

From c)
- Phone systems are often engaged or have long wait periods (the service is not promptly)

## Recommendations (350 words)

The audit has revealed that BM Services is in need of a major overhaul in its customer service standards. The company is losing return customers and the head office regularly receives complaints about poor service standards, most prominently in the lack of prompt service, as well as failure to identify and meet customer requirements.

Regarding the lack of prompt service, BM Services should consider hiring more staff to reduce wait times. This will also help in reducing the tension in the workplace, as staff will not be overworked. The company should also consider investing in a better phone system to increase the effectiveness of the service, as a lack of efficiency in the phone system was identified through the survey. This can be achieved by implementing a callback system, where customers can leave their number and receive a call back when a staff member is available. Furthermore, the company should consider the implementation of online chat support, which will allow customers to receive immediate help without having to wait on the phone. Data gathered from such a system can also be used to identify commonly asked questions, which can be referred to in the future to reduce wait times. Chatbots could also be implemented to answer simple questions, freeing up staff to deal with more complex issues. Finally, appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be set to monitor the performance of the staff and the phone system.

The lack of understanding of customer requirements is another major issue. In an agile manner, the company should also consider the involvement of the customer in the development process to capture evolving requirements and tracking the interactions through a customer relationship management system. A trained Business Analyst should be involved in said process to identify the customer needs while ensuring that the development teams understand the requirements effectively and accurately. Additional training should be provided along with a clear set of guidelines to ensure that staff are treating customers with respect and empathy. A customer feedback system should also be implemented to allow customers to provide feedback on their experience, allowing the identification of areas for improvement.

In conclusion, the issues identified in the audit could be resolved through a variety of methods, including the implementation of new technology, the hiring of new staff, and the involvement of the customer in the development process.
