Organisational Responsibilities for managing WHS
In Queensland, Australia, the organisational responsibilities for managing Work Health and Safety (WHS) under current legislation are as follows:
Ensure safe systems of work: Organisations must establish and maintain safe methods of working to prevent workplace accidents and injuries.
Ensure safe use and handling of goods and substances: Organisations are required to ensure that goods and substances are used and handled in a manner that is safe and does not pose a risk to health.
Provide information, instruction, training and supervision: It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide necessary information, instruction, training and supervision to workers to ensure their safety at work.
Assess risks and implement appropriate measures to manage and control them: Organisations are required to identify potential hazards, assess the risks associated with them, and implement appropriate measures to manage and control these risks.
Report notifiable incidents to Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (WHSQ). Business owner or employer is legally required to do so, and there are penalties if they don’t.
Investigate incidents and take action to avoid having something similar happen again. An incident response plan should be used to prepare and reduce potential harm and damage to the people and the business.
Provide workers' compensation insurance. Workers must be insured against work-related injury or illness.
These responsibilities are outlined in Queensland’s work health and safety legal framework which includes the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011. The laws aim to protect the health, safety and welfare of all workers, as well as the health and safety of all other people who might be affected by the work.
Duty of Care of Stakeholders
The “Duty of Care” is a responsibility to make sure that one self and other people are safe in the workplace.
In Queensland, Australia, the “Duty of Care” of stakeholders, particularly for employers and businesses, is defined under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Here are the key responsibilities:
Provide a Safe Work Environment: Employers must ensure the health and safety of all workers, clients, visitors, and volunteers at their place of work.
Safe Use, Handling, and Storage: This includes machinery, structures, and substances.
Maintenance: Facilities must be well-maintained and at an acceptable standard.
Training and Supervision: Employers must provide any information, training, instruction, or supervision needed for safety.
Monitor Health and Conditions: Employers should keep an eye on the health of workers and conditions at the workplace.
Keep an injury register: All injuries sustained by workers must be reported for potential compensation.
Workers’ Compensation Policy and Return to Work Plan: Employers must have a workers’ compensation policy and a return to work plan.
Additionally, the Act requires duty holders to consult, cooperate, and coordinate activities with others who have a duty in relation to the same matter. This includes consultation with workers who carry out work for the business or undertaking.
PCBUs (Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking)
A Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) has a primary duty under the Work Health and Safety (WHS) laws to ensure the health and safety of workers while they are at work in the business or undertaking, as well as others who may be affected by the work The primary duties of a PCBU include, but are not limited to:
Provision and maintenance of a safe work environment: This includes the workplace layout, lighting, work areas, floors and surfaces, entries and exits, fixtures and fittings, ventilation.
Provision and maintenance of safe plant and structures: PCBUs must ensure that all machinery, equipment, appliances, implements, tools, and structures are safe.
Provision and maintenance of safe systems of work: PCBUs must establish and maintain safe methods of working to prevent workplace accidents and injuries.
Safe use, handling, and storage of plant, structures, and substances: PCBUs are required to ensure that goods and substances are used and handled in a manner that is safe and does not pose a risk to health.
Provision of accessible and adequate facilities: This includes access to washrooms, lockers, dining areas, toilets, drinking water, washing and eating facilities, first aid equipment and facilities.
Provision of any instruction, training, information, and supervision: PCBUs must provide adequate training, information, and instruction to ensure that each worker is safe from injury and risks to health.
Monitoring of workers health and conditions at the workplace: PCBUs must manage the risks to a worker’s psychological health, so far as is reasonably practicable.
Consulting with workers and representatives: PCBUs must consult with workers who carry out work for the business or undertaking and who are, or are likely to be, directly affected by a health and safety matter.


Safe Work Method Statements
A PCBU that carries out high risk construction has additional WHS duties. These include requirements to prepare, keep, comply with and review a SWMS for the work. The PCBU must provide give the SWMS to the principal contractor.  
A SWMS is a document that sets out: https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/safety-topic/industry-and-business/construction/managing-risks
high risk construction work activities 
hazards that could happen from these activities  
how the PCBU will control the risks 
Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) are a crucial part of managing Work Health and Safety (WHS) in Queensland, Australia:
Purpose: The primary purpose of a SWMS is to help supervisors, workers, and any other persons at the workplace understand the requirements that have been established to carry out high-risk construction work in a safe and healthy manner.
Content: A SWMS sets out the work activities in logical sequences, identifies hazards, and describes control measures. It should describe the activity or task to be undertaken, identify the resources, manpower, and skills associated with the task, assess and select control measures (as appropriate), and systematically plan the activity so it can be completed efficiently and effectively.
Duty Holders: A person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) carrying out high-risk construction work is required under the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (WHS Regulation) to ensure that a SWMS is prepared before the proposed work starts1. All duty holders involved in a high-risk work activity must make sure the work is carried out in accordance with the SWMS.
High-Risk Construction Work: High-risk construction work involves a risk of a person falling more than 2 m, is carried out on a telecommunication tower, involves demolition of an element of a structure that is load-bearing or related to the physical integrity of the structure, involves disturbing asbestos, involves structural alteration or repair that requires temporary support to prevent collapse, and more.
Review and Update: A SWMS should be reviewed and revised if necessary, and kept until the high-risk construction work is completed. It should be readily available for inspection.

Toolbox talks in construction industry

In this case study, it can be observed that there were significant failures in WHS training, supervision, and communication, leading to a tragic accident resulting in 2 fatalities and various serious injuries. Furthermore, Let's examine whether Safe Toolbox Talks could have prevented the accident or not:

Identification of Safety Risks: 
Safe Toolbox Talks, which typically involve short safety meetings or discussions before work begins. It could have provided an opportunity for workers and management to identify  any dangers they saw on the construction site and discuss potential safety risks associated with the construction project. By facilitating open dialogue, These talks would have let everyone share their worries and maybe prevent the accident.


Fall protection and prevention, & promoting safety culture:
Safe Toolbox Talks contribute to fostering a culture of safety within the workplace.Using the proper safety equipments means that If you are working at heights, be sure to wear a harness and tie off to a secure anchor point. In this case, If integrated into the daily routine, these talks reinforce the importance of safety as a priority and empower workers to actively participate in maintaining a safe working environment. This cultural shift could have prompted workers to speak up about safety concerns and prompted management to take necessary corrective actions.

Collapsing trenches/caught between: (Work safety, 2024)One of the biggest dangers on construction sites is the collapsing of trenches with workers caught inside. This accounts for almost 7 per cent of construction fatalities. To prevent collapsing trenches, ensure that the kind of support used is best suited for the trench. Any trench with a depth of 5 feet or deeper must have sufficient trench wall support and appropriate safety measures. Also, ensure that the trench is regularly inspected before and during work shifts.  Finally, ensure all utilities are clearly marked prior to digging and all employees are trained on how to properly protect themselves.
Work area inspections and what to focus on: 
A work area inspection is a visual assessment of the work environment that is conducted in order to identify potential hazards. These inspections can be conducted by employees, supervisors, or safety professionals. Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), Be aware of your surroundings and work safely, Follow all safety procedures and protocols, Report any potential hazards to your supervisor or safety professional

Managing risks in construction is an important part of keeping people safe in a dangerous environment.  
This includes: 
working through the hierarchy of control measures  
creating an emergency plan and  
completing and implementing a safe work management plan (SWMS) for any high-risk construction.

# Case Study: When WHS training, supervision and communication fail

Case Study 1: When WHS training, supervision and communication fail
This Case Study report has been adapted for the QIBA PYP Program and is used for the assessment of Module 2: Australian Workplace Culture (Work, Health and Safety)

 

Extract from Workplace OHS (based on NSW IRC File 1446 of 2008)

A State Government Public Works Department worked closely with an external company to design and construct an on-site water storage facility. As workers began concreting the roof of a tower at the site, the underlying structure failed and collapsed, and the working deck fell into the reservoir. It was found that the department’s safety management systems were comprehensive "on paper" but had not been adequately implemented which resulted in the death of two contractors. 

Background

During a visit to the site two months prior to the incident, the department's project manager, who was both trained and authorised to direct work being performed on the site by the external companies employees, directed one minor change to the structures support, but failed to identify other obvious high risk safety issues. 


It was later noted that even a cursory examination of the site by an adequately trained officer should have been sufficient to halt work on the site long before this incident occurred.


The government department admitted to awarding the contract to the external company on the basis of price alone. It also confessed to a "widespread failure" to supervise the site, but said it was not responsible for the creation, provision or maintenance of the external companies system of work.


A construction worker and the external company’s director were killed. Three other workers standing on the deck suffered serious injuries. 
The department was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, breaching their duty of care obligations. In an Industrial Relations Court decision, the presiding Justice found that the government department had failed to: 
•	undertake adequate safety inspections and safety audits (State requirement); 
•	ensure the scaffolding access tower and formwork were safe; 
•	ensure the formwork was properly certified before the concrete pour; and 
•	properly supervise, train and instruct its project manager/superintendent's representative.

The department's response
In an immediate response to the incident, the Department issued a circular introducing a new requirement to strengthen the safety management procedure. That circular drew attention to the high risk of the erection of concrete suspended slabs and that risk required a standard approach to be introduced for all project management group contacts. Following a review of the effectiveness of measures introduced in response to this incident, the Department held a full day workshop with its senior managers to discuss safety management and identify areas for improvement. 
System changes – A new program introduced
In response the outcomes of the investigation and court proceedings, a new comprehensive programme was developed known as the ‘Construction Safety Improvement Programme’. This Programme included changes in procedures, contract clauses and training for all Departmental staff. It also included a review of management responsibilities, reporting responsibilities and standard contract safety provisions and procedures to ensure they were appropriate and if necessary, improved 
Construction Safety Co-ordinators were appointed to all regions and branches where they had not already been appointed and specialists were to undertake audits, inspections and provide training and support to project managers 
Safety networks and regular review meetings introduced
A Construction Safety Network was established to meet monthly to allow sharing of information and enable staff to learn from the experiences of others 
Communication strategies
The Department introduced an intranet based project management programme entitled "The Roadmap", the Roadmap is able to be utilised by staff every day to effectively manage projects. Staff were provided with training in the use of the Roadmap and became an integral part of their induction process. The Roadmap was available at every site in state and enabled easy access by project managers to a wide range of safety information, including the project details. The Roadmap operated to required regular reviews during its four phases and, at particular stages, the project manager referred to documents and information that may be needed to manage the project. 
Management review
A strengthening of the Department's management review (including the introduction of the Deputy Director-General Safety Forum) and commitment to safety leadership. 
A substantial increase in the number of Project Safety Advisors employed by the Department. The employment of additional Project Safety Advisors was an outcome of the Construction Safety Improvement Program. The increase in the number of Project Safety Advisors means that at least one Project Safety Advisor is based in each office or branch.

# Analysis

<!-- Summary of the case study -->

During a construction project where a State Government Public Works Department worked closely with an external company to design and construct an on-site water storage facility, the underlying structure failed and collapsed, resulting in the death of two contractors and serious injuries to three other workers. The department shown to have failed to meet their Organisational Responsibilities for Managing WHS, and fulfilling the Duty of Care of Stakeholders, and the primary duties of a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU).

## Organisational Responsibilities for managing WHS

In general, business owners and employers have a legal responsibility to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all workers, as well as the health and safety of all other people who might be affected by the work. This includes the responsibility to 1) ensure safe systems of work; 2) ensure safe use and handling of goods and substances; 3) provide information, instruction, training and supervision; 4) assess risks and implement appropriate measures to manage and control them; 5) report notifiable incidents to Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (WHSQ); 6) investigate incidents and take action to avoid having something similar happen again; and 7) provide workers' compensation insurance. 

In this tragic case, the department failed to meet responsibilities 1, 3 and 4. Firstly, the department failed to ensure the scaffolding access tower and formwork were safe, and to ensure the formwork was properly certified before the concrete pour. Secondly, the department failed to undertake adequate safety inspections and safety audits. Finally, the department failed to properly supervise, train and instruct its project manager/superintendent's representative. Failure to meet these legal responsibilities resulted in the death of two contractors and serious injuries to three other workers, and the department was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, breaching their duty of care obligations.

## Duty of Care of Stakeholders

<!-- Identify: 
- Main elements of the Duty of Care under the WHS Act, 
- The responsibilities of a PCBU (Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking). 

This includes a discussion of:
- How the failures could have been avoided,
- What procedures should be in place to avoid a re-occurrence of any such critical incidents  -->

Under the WHS Act, the Duty of Care of stakeholders, particularly for employers and businesses, is defined under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. The key responsibilities include providing 1) a safe work environment, 2) safe use, handling, and storage of goods and substances, 3) maintenance, 4) training and supervision, 5) monitoring of workers health and conditions, 6) keeping an injury register, and 7) having a workers’ compensation policy and a return to work plan. 

A group of Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU), such as the External Contracting Company and Supervisors, is also involved in this project. They are primarily responsible for the 1) provision and maintenance of a safe work environment, 2) safe plant and structures, 3) safe systems of work, 4) safe use, handling, and storage of plant, structures, and substances, 5) provision of accessible and adequate facilities, 6) provision of any instruction, training, information, and supervision, 7) monitoring of workers health and conditions at the workplace, and 8) consulting with workers and representatives.

The failures could have been avoided if the department had properly supervised, trained and instructed its project manager/superintendent's representative, and undertaken adequate safety inspections. 

These processes should be implemented to avoid a re-occurrence of any such critical incidents. Extensive risk assessments and safety audits should be conducted before the commencement of any construction project, and regular safety inspections should be carried out to ensure that the work environment is kept safe. Effective communication and consultation with workers and representatives should be encouraged to identify potential hazards and risks, and to develop and implement appropriate control measures.
